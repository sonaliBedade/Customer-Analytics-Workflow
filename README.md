# Customer-Analytics-Workflow using DBT and BigQuery

This project showcases an end-to-end customer data transformation and analytics workflow using **dbt (Data Build Tool)** and **Google BigQuery**.  
It focuses on structuring raw customer data into clean, trusted datasets ready for analysis â€” and extracting valuable business insights like customer loyalty, churn behavior, and overall activity trends.

---

## Project Overview

In real-world business environments, raw customer data is often messy, inconsistent, and hard to use directly for decision-making.  
This project simulates a modern data workflow where raw data is:

- Transformed and modeled into clean structures
- Tested for quality
- Documented for transparency
- Analyzed to generate meaningful insights

By following best practices in data engineering and analytics, this project builds a robust foundation for trustworthy business intelligence.

## Tools & Technologies

- dbt (Data Build Tool): For data transformation, testing, and documentation.
- Google BigQuery: As the cloud data warehouse to store and query the data.
- SQL: For all transformation logic and insights extraction.

---

## Key Steps

1. Data Transformation:
   - Built dbt models to clean and organize raw customer data.
   - Structured fields like customer IDs, names, first/most recent orders, and number of orders.

2. Data Testing:
   - Implemented dbt tests to ensure data integrity (e.g., primary key uniqueness, no nulls in critical fields).

3. Data Documentation:
   - Generated dbt documentation to provide model descriptions, column details, and lineage graphs.

4. Data Analysis:
   - Queried BigQuery to extract insights such as:
     - Top 10 loyal customers
     - Average number of orders per customer
     - Churned customers (inactive >180 days)
     - New vs Returning customer breakdown
     - Customer active lifespan analysis

5. Visualization:
   - Created basic charts directly in BigQuery to visualize key metrics like loyalty distribution and churn rates.

## Business Impact

By implementing this workflow:
- Data becomes structured, consistent, and reliable for analysis.
- Businesses can quickly identify high-value customers and churn risks.
- Data quality is monitored automatically using dbt testing.
- Teams gain clear documentation and data lineage visibility, reducing onboarding time for new members.

## Analysis:

Query 1 - finding top 10 loyal customers

![Loyals](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/886921ba-a05b-4c73-84f3-8c8129196cc7)

SELECT id,
first_name,
last_name,
number_of_orders
FROM `dbt-bq-458200.dbt_bq_data.customers` 
order by number_of_orders desc
limit 10

Query 2 - average number of orders per customer

select 
cast(floor(avg(number_of_orders)) as int64) as avg_orders_per_customer
from dbt-bq-458200.dbt_bq_data.customers

Query 3 - churn analysis (customers inactive for 2+ months)

with latest_date as (
  select max(most_recent_order) as latest_order_date
  from dbt-bq-458200.dbt_bq_data.customers
)

select
id, 
first_name,
last_name,
most_recent_order
from dbt-bq-458200.dbt_bq_data.customers, latest_date
where date_diff(latest_date.latest_order_date, most_recent_order, DAY) > 80

Query 4 - new vs returning customer

![returning_vs_new](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a05c619-7832-4248-8139-8057861da0f9)

select
case
when number_of_orders = 1 then "new customer"
else "returning customer"
end as customer_type, count(*) as num_customers
from dbt-bq-458200.dbt_bq_data.customers
group by customer_type

Query 5 - customer activity time span

select
id,
first_name,
last_name,
date_diff(most_recent_order, first_order, DAY) as active_days
from dbt-bq-458200.dbt_bq_data.customers
order by active_days desc
limit 10
